This is a part of the final project for Programming Languages Principle subject at Chulalongkorn University.

The project involves creating a grammar for "verbal programming language" and its parser. However, the parser just needs to accept or reject the text for now. No need to generate the output program yet.

This repository contains a parser for LL(1) grammar. The "parseProperly" function receives a grammar and a string as parameters, and checks whether the text follows the grammar correctly.
